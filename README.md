# 🩺 Breast Cancer Classification using Logistic Regression

This project builds a logistic regression model to classify tumors as malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer dataset from `sklearn.datasets`.

## Workflow
1. Data loading and preprocessing  
2. Feature scaling  
3. Model training (Logistic Regression)  
4. Evaluation using accuracy, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix  

## Result
- Accuracy: 97%
- AUC Score: 0.99
- The model performs well and generalizes effectively on unseen data.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
